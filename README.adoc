== Introduction
Providing and maintaining documentation for *developers*, *agile testers*, and *DevOps engineers* side by
side with the source-code reduces the maintenance effort. The motivation behind this template is to provide
 an easy way to include <<asciidoc>> based documentation in a GitHub repository.

=== Documentation Skeleton

The topics of the skeleton are parts which are often integrated in repositories to cope with the 
different needs of developers and DevOps engineers. 

* Getting Started (only page)
* Reference / API Documentation (only page)
* Examples Documentation (only page)
* Architecture Documentation - The <<arc42>> Template (complete - with help)
* Development Environment Setup (only page)
* Continuos Integration / Continuos Deployment Setup (only page)

=== Documentation Publishing 
The documentation is written in the <<asciidoc>> language and processed by a GitHub action 
which stores the resulting HTML pages in the gh-pages branch which is published as github pages.

=== Documentation Editing
The Repository contains a Visual Studio Code configuration, so that external images and Diagrams are rendered in the 
asciidoc preview extension.

=== Diagraming
The <<asciidoc-diagram>> extension is enabled in the github action and the vscode editing preview. Among others it allows to integrate <<plantuml>> diagrams.
