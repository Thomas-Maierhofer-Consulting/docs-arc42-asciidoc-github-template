== Introduction
Providing an easy way to include <<asciidoc>> base documentation in a github repository.

=== Documentation Publishing 
The documentation is written in the <<asciidoc>> language and processed by a GitHub action 
which stores the resulting HTML pages in the gh-pages branch which is published as github pages.

=== Documentation Editing
The Repository contains a Visual Studio Code configuration, so that external images and Diagrams are rendered in the 
asciidoc preview extension.
